<h1>What am I getting myself into as a sponsor?</h1>
<p>The Testing Study Escape is a week long trip away for testers to deep dive into testing topics that will benefit the community.  Some of the outputs that we are looking to create are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog post</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Training course</li>
<li>Workshop </li>
<li>Conference submission</li>
<li>Book chapter(s)</li>
<li>Presentation (talk)</li>
<li>Webinar</li>
<li>White paper</li>
<li>Website</li>
</ul>

<p>We would love sponsors so that we can supliment the trip for attendees.  Attendees will be giving up a week of their lives to improve testing for the masses so we would like to be able to support them by making the trip as cheap as we can for them.  </p>

<h2>What will I get?</h2>
<p>We like to keep the event as low cost for us as well as the sponsors so we require 6 sponsors in total for a cost of £1000 each. In return for sponsorship, you will receive the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logo and mention on the website</li>
<li>Shout outs on Twitter and LinkedIn in the lead up to the event</li>
<li>Offer the attendees swag from our sponsors such as stickers, USB drives or any other merchandise that you think is suitable.</li>
<li>A blog post from the organisers for your website to say how your company has helped the testing community</li>
</ul>
