<h1>What am I getting myself into as a sponsor?</h1>
<p>The Testing Study Escape is a week long trip away for testers to deep dive into testing topics that will benefit the community.  Some of the outputs that we are looking to create are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blog post</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Training course</li>
<li>WorkshopÂ </li>
<li>Conference submission</li>
<li>Book chapter(s)</li>
<li>Presentation (talk)</li>
<li>Webinar</li>
<li>White paper</li>
<li>Website</li>
</ul>

<p>We would love sponsors so that we can supliment the trip for attendees.  Attendees will be giving up a week of their lives to improve testing for the masses so we would like to be able to support them by making the trip as cheap as we can for them.  </p>
