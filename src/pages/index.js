<h2>What?</h2>
<p>A study trip to Scotland for people interested in testing to deep dive into a specific topic.</p>
<h2>When? </h2>
<p>Saturday, 29 Aug 2020 to Saturday, 05 Sep 2020. For details, please refer to the <Link to="/schedule">schedule.</Link></p>
<h2>Who? </h2>
<p>Up to 17 people. The organisers will seek a balance of participants from among those interested.</p>
<h2>How? </h2>
<p>We have booked a large house and cottages in Perth, Scotland. To maximise study time and to keep costs down, Gwen has suggested a friend to attend who can look after cooking breakfast, lunch and dinner at a cost of £1000 and free accommodation.</p>
<p>Registration isn't open yet, but <a href="https://me843905.typeform.com/to/LvzU5H">give us your name and your email here</a> and we'll let you know when it is.
</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Last year, Gwen went to Krakow and studied philosophy for three days, ate noodles and had a brilliant time. She would like to extend the learning opportunity to other testers in a serene setting with a discussion at the end.</p>
